    A crisis is a bold time to start a new hospital.

  <p>
    Community hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open. Communities are losing access. Providers are burning out.
  </p>
  <p>
    It all stems from a system of care that hasn’t changed—not really—in over 100 years.
    Faced with fundamental questions, hospitals are buckling under century old answers.
    <!-- Questions with good answers a century ago lack modern answers. -->
    <!-- Sunk costs, inertia -->
    <!-- Century-old decisions are difficult to question, but that's exactly what we need to do. -->
    <!-- Hospitals are buckling under sunk costs and  -->
    <!-- Decisions made a century ago have become difficult to question, let alone change. -->
    <!-- Decisions made a century ago have become difficult to question as hospitals buckle under sunk costs. -->
    <!-- Hospitals are buckling under reasons <i>why</i> that are obsolete. -->
    <!-- (We've inherited...) -->
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> isn’t care provided consistently from patient to patient?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> are patients kept in hospital when outcomes are better at home?
  </p>
  <!-- <p>
       <i>Why</i> isn't discharing patients a top priority when their outcomes are better at home?
       </p> -->
  <!-- <p>
       <i>Why</i> do providers lose so much time outside of providing care?
       </p> -->
  <!-- <p>
       <i>Why</i> do providers have to fight for time to provide care?
       </p> -->
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> is so little provider time spent providing care?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> do operating rooms sit empty on weekends while backlogs of patients grow?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> do hospitals grow upwards in size and complexity rather than out into their communities?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> does knowledge collect in siloes rather than lift the whole institution?
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>Why</i> does becoming a care provider mean losing work/life balance?
  </p>
  <p>
    If we don’t do something bold, the system will break. Software alone can't change it. AI will not save us. Half measures have failed again and again.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we can fix it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The best time to reinvent the hospital was yesterday. The next best time is today.

    A future for community hospitals.
