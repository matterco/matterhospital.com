    Matter is a hospital.
  </h1>
  <h2 class="text-6xl mt-8">
    A new model of community hospital with an innovative approach to care.
  </h2>
  <p class="mt-8">
    A crisis is a bold time to start a community hospital.
    Many are shuttering, communities are losing access, and providers are burning out.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    It all stems from a system of care that hasn’t changed—not really—in over 100 years. It's buckling under reasons <i>why</i> that are obsolete.
    <!-- (We've inherited...) -->
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    <i>Why</i> isn’t care provided consistently from patient to patient?
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    <i>Why</i> do we keep patients in hospital when their outcomes are better at home?
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    <i>Why</i> is so much provider time wasted on things other than providing care?
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    <i>Why</i> do operating rooms sit empty on weekends while backlogs of patients grow?
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    <i>Why</i> do hospitals grow in size and complexity rather than growing out into their communities?
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    <i>Why</i> doesn't the insitution learn as it matures?
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    If we don’t do something bold, the system will break. There’s no magic software platform. AI will not save us. Half measures have failed again and again.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    But we can fix it.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-8">
    The best time to reinvent the hospital was yesterday. The second best time is today.
