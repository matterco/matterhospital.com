  <p>
    Community hospitals are struggling to keep their doors open.
    Communities are losing access.
    Providers are burning out.
  </p>
  <p>
    It all stems from a system of care delivery that hasn’t changed—not really—in over 100 years.
    Faced with fundamental questions, hospitals are buckling under century old answers.
    <!-- Questions with good answers a century ago lack modern answers. -->
    <!-- Sunk costs, inertia -->
    <!-- Century-old decisions are difficult to question, but that's exactly what we need to do. -->
    <!-- Hospitals are buckling under sunk costs and  -->
    <!-- Decisions made a century ago have become difficult to question, let alone change. -->
    <!-- Decisions made a century ago have become difficult to question as hospitals buckle under sunk costs. -->
    <!-- Hospitals are buckling under reasons why that are obsolete. -->
    <!-- (We've inherited...) -->

  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why isn’t care provided consistently<br>
    from patient to patient?

    Why are patients kept in hospital<br>

       Why isn't discharing patients a top priority when their outcomes are better at home?

       Why do providers lose so much time outside of providing care?

  <!-- <p class="italic text-center">
       Why do providers have to fight for time to provide care?
       </p> -->
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why aren't providers empowered<br>
    to make efficient use of their time?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why is work-life balance<br>
    so hard to achieve as a provider?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why do operating rooms sit empty on weekends<br>
    as patient backlogs grow?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why does knowledge collect in siloes<br>
    rather than inform the whole institution?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why do hospitals grow in size and complexity<br>
    rather than out into their communities?
  </p>
  <p>
    If we don’t do something bold, the system will break. Bolting on software isn't enough. AI will not save us. Half measures have failed again and again.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we can fix it, if we work from the ground up.

    The best time to reinvent the hospital was yesterday.<br>
    The next best time is today.
