    A crisis is a bold time
    to start a hospital.
  </h1>
  <p>
    Community hospitals are struggling to survive.
    Access to care is disap&shy;pearing.
    Providers are burning out.
  </p>
  <p>
    It all stems from a system of care delivery that hasn’t changed—not really—in over 100 years.
    Faced with fundamental questions, hospitals are buckling under century old answers.
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why isn’t care provided consistently<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    from patient to patient?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why are patients kept in hospital<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    when outcomes are better at home?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why aren't providers empowered<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    to make efficient use of their time?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why is work-life balance<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    so hard to achieve as a provider?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why do operating rooms sit empty on weekends<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    as patient backlogs grow?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why does knowledge collect in siloes<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    rather than inform the whole institution?
  </p>
  <p class="italic text-center">
    Why do hospitals grow in size and complexity<br class="hidden sm:inline">
    rather than out into their communities?
  </p>
  <p>
    If we don’t do something bold, the system will break. Bolting on software isn't enough. AI will not save us. Half measures have failed again and again.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we can fix it, if we work from the ground up.
  </p>

    The best time to reinvent the hospital was yesterday.
